Sema4_proj

This is my project for shortening URLs. It uses NodeJS and allows you to easily convert much longer URLs into shorter ones for the purposes of including them in papers, sending them to friends or posting them on social media, particularly with Twitter where the number of characters you get is limited. I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have about this project and it would be a pleasure to join your team! -Eric
